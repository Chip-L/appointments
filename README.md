## Installation

Dependencies are locked with a `yarn.lock` file, so please use `yarn` instead of `npm` to install them.

`yarn install`

## Usage

### `yarn test`

Launches the Jest (Unit) test runner. Note, this is not in the interactive watch mode, so you will need to do `yarn test --watchAll` to get it to continuously watch the functions.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

## Technologies

- React
- Webpack
- Jest

## Credits

This project is based on the first project from the book **Mastering React Test-Driven Development: Build simple and maintainable web apps with React, Redux, and GraphQL** by Daniel Irvine.

This did not use Create-React-App nor does it use the React Testing Library. This is a very minimalist application. "
